# Hello-World
First Git Repository

Hello ladies and gentlemen!  Dweiss044 here, creating his first git repository.  Extremely excited to be getting started with branching projects to keep all my work together.  Will be using Github initially for organizing the code for the Robotics Team at Ballou Senior High School, FRC team 615.
